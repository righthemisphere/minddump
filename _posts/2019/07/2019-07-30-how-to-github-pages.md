Hey, Laurie!
======

This is Github Pages. I promise it's really easy to get really fast when using Github Pages, but it's going to have a bit of a learning curve.

**Buckle your seatbelt.**

This is not quite as, um, convenient as using something like Wordpress is, but for what I believe is a _small_ sacrifice of convenience you get a lot more power. The power that you get is that Github Pages uses _markdown_, which is a markup language designed to be mostly human-readable **without needing to render fonts, colors, styles, just content** and at the same time be compiled to HTML. Think of it as "HTML Light".

This means that you can do almost anything you want to do in HTML in a document that's way more readable. (In fact, raw, direct HTML is valid Markdown, so you can do literally anything HTML can do...)

For instance, I want to give you a link to a website that describes Markdown, so I'm going to [give you a link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to that website. If you view the raw file here, you can see what the link looks like both when you're authoring it and when it's previewed in HTML.
