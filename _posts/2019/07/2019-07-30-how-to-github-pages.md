Hey, Laurie!
======

This is Github Pages. I promise it's really easy to get really fast when using Github Pages, but it's going to have a slight learning curve. I promise, it's not that big...

**Buckle your seatbelt.**

This is not quite as, um, convenient as using something like Wordpress is, but for what I believe is a _small_ sacrifice of convenience you get a lot more power. The power that you get is that Github Pages uses _markdown_, which is a markup language designed to be mostly human-readable **without needing to render fonts, colors, styles, just content** and at the same time be compiled to HTML. Think of it as "HTML Light".

This means that you can do almost anything you want to do in HTML in a document that's way more readable than HTML is. (In fact, raw, direct HTML is valid Markdown, so you can do literally anything HTML can do...)

For instance, I want to give you a link to a website that describes Markdown, so I'm going to [give you a link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to that website. If you view [the raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/righthemisphere/minddump/master/_posts/2019/07/2019-07-30-how-to-github-pages.md) here, you can see what the link looks like both when you're authoring it and when it's previewed in HTML on [your website](http://righthemisphere.github.io/minddump/meta/2019/07/30/how-to-github-pages.html/)

I expect we'll spend more time chatting about how to set up the site (it's very convention-driven, but you'll learn for sure) but for now, if you just create new files under the `_posts` directory using the Github editor, and committing them, we can capture that content and publish it later.
