Well done! Now to put this into action!

In the meantime, do what you can to avoid adding microplastics into the overall system. Microplastics include microfibers from washing synthetic clothing as well as pieces of plastic, say, the caps to bottles, that seem large enough to be recycled, but instead get passed by. 

Certainly there are many approaches, but my strategy is to avoid synthetic clothing whenever possible, and wear my existing synthetics (just about everything stretchy!) until they fall apart, and wash them as infrequently as possible.  Over time there are fewer microfibers to be washed. When my workout gear wears out, I look for replacements on ThredUp, where I can find previously-enjoyed items that I know I'm just going to destroy anyway.

As it comes to food and beverage packaging, I prioritize cans and glass over anything that comes in plastic, using my own bulk containers whenever possible. Companies like Straus Creamery collect their bottles for reuseâ€“including the caps! I've asked them directly, both Albert Straus, and his director of sustainability, in person. Straus would like you to return the bottles with the caps on, so they can make sure they are recycled properly, as they too are considered microplastics.
